## Description
This application is a limited and demonstration version. It is developed for managers of a company that provides services to clients on-site. In real-time during phone conversations, upon receiving the client's address, the manager can determine which employee is closest and can arrive at the client's location the fastest, using a few clicks and provides various options. The manager can then offer the client several options and book the time using an external CRM system with just one click in this app. In real-life scenarios, determining free dates and times involves data from the external CRM system, while determining the shortest distance to the client among all employees involves data from the Google Directions API. In this version of the application, all data comes from a test server located in the ./server folder.
